**Personal Fitness Tracker**

This Python application is a personal fitness tracker that allows you to log your workouts, nutrition, and view summaries of your progress.

## Features

* Log workouts including date, type, duration, and calories burned.
* Log nutrition including date and food item (currently limited to vegetarian options).
* Calculate total calories burned and consumed for a specified period (weekly or monthly).
* View detailed workout and nutrition logs within a timeframe.

## Running the Application

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Python 3.x
   - `pandas` library (install using `pip install pandas`)
   - `tkinter` library (included in most Python installations)
   - `datetime` library (included in Python standard library)

2. **Download or Clone the Repository**
   [Replace with instructions on how to download or clone your project repository]

3. **Run the Script**
   Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python fitness_tracker.py  # Replace 'fitness_tracker.py' with your actual script name
   ```

## Using the Application

The application window will consist of three main sections:

* **Log Workout:** Enter details like date, workout type, duration, and calories burned to log your workouts. Click the "Add Workout" button to save the entry.
* **Log Nutrition:** Enter the date and select a vegetarian food item from the list. Click the "Add Nutrition" button to log your meal.
* **Summary:** Select a timeframe (weekly or monthly) and click "Show Summary" to view the total calories burned and consumed during that period. Additionally, detailed logs for workouts and nutrition entries within the timeframe will be displayed.

## Customization

Currently, the application provides a fixed list of vegetarian food items with pre-defined calorie values. You can modify these in the `vegetarian_foods` dictionary within the script (`fitness_tracker.py`) to reflect your dietary preferences.
